# OldContextualMenu
## A simple script for Windows 11 to bring back the Windows 10 context menu.
The explanation is very simple. With the first command, we create a new registry entry that replaces the new context menu with the old one whenever we right-click. Then, the second command is used to kill the Windows Explorer process so that the changes take effect immediately. Finally, the third command is used to restart the explorer process.

## How to use
1. Download `OldContextualMenu.bat`
2. Right click > Execute as administrator
3. A terminal will be opened and the process will be done quickly
