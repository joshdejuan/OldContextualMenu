# OldContextualMenu
### A simple batch script for Windows with a menu to switch between Windows 10 or 11 contextual menu.

The explanation is very simple.

It creates a new registry entry that replaces the new context menu with the old one whenever we right-click.

The second command is used to kill the Windows Explorer process so that the changes take effect immediately.

Finally, the third command is used to restart the explorer process.

## How to use
1. Download `OldContextualMenu.bat`
2. Right click > ``Execute as administrator``.
3. A terminal will be opened with the principal menu.
